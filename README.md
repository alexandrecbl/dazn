#DANZ Coding Challenge

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Must display a list of movies as default from moviedbapi
- Must be able to search through those movies
- Must call moviedbapi when the movie is not found in the preset list
- Must display the movie detail page when a movie is clicked

**Install:**
`npm install`

**Run tests:**
`npm test`

**With a bit more time I would've:**
- Separated api calls to other components so they could be tested independently
- Written more tests for those api calls
- Written integration tests
- Added loaders for images and API calls
- Added more functionality to the search like filters and lazy loading results
